# User Research question script: Lit Learn

## Introduction 
 Thank for helping us today. Just so you know,  this is ... and they will be observing the session and taking notes of the session so iI don't miss anything.There's also some of my team observing the session from a seperate location, they're viewing the screen on our testing device and can hear your voice, so won't be a distraction. My name is ...., I’m a developer on the application, the application we're working on is a tool for helping students practise for their English GCSE exams.

## Explanation 
I’d like to show you the application first. *(show them home page)* I’m going to give you a few tasks to do from the our home page. It's a very free exercise so there are no right or wrong ways of doing things, this is not about you getting something wrong or right, we're looking to learn about the application. So that we know how you're finding it, we want you to talk aloud whatever you're thinking. So as you explore it, tell us anything that comes into your mind.

## Tasks

### Task 1
The first task I’d like you to do is to open the LitLearn app and complete a short question, as if you were trying out whether the app is something you would want to use. Whenever you're ready please begin.

### Task 2
The next task is to move on to the next question and get a hint before answering.

### Task 3
Compare your answers to someone else's and then improve your original answer. 

### Task 4
The next task is to answer a long question and review your progress. 

## Wrap up 
May I ask you a few additional questions about yourself?
* What is your occupation?
* Do you use apps often?
    * Which apps do you use?
    * Why do you use them?
    * What do you like about them?
    * Dislike about them?
* Have you used similar apps before?
    * What made you chose this/those apps?
    * What do you like about them?
    * Dislike about them?
* Do you have any questions for me?

## Thanks
The session is now complete, I’d like to thank you for the help you’ve given us to improve our application.
