# User Research question script: Lit Learn

## Introduction 
 Thank for helping us today. Just so you know,  this is ... and they will be observing the session and taking notes of the session so iI don't miss anything.There's also some of my team observing the session from a seperate location, they're viewing the screen on our testing device and can hear your voice, so won't be a distraction. My name is ...., I’m a developer on the application, the application we're working on is a tool for helping students practise for their English GCSE exams.

## Explanation 
I’d like to show you the application first. *(show them home page)* I’m going to give you a few tasks to do from the our home page. It's a very free exercise so there are no right or wrong ways of doing things, this is not about you getting something wrong or right, we're looking to learn about the application. So that we know how you're finding it, we want you to talk aloud whatever you're thinking. So as you explore it, tell us anything that comes into your mind.

## Tasks

### Task 1
The first task I’d like you to do is to open the LitLearn app and complete a short question, as if you were trying out whether the app is something you would want to use. Whenever you're ready please begin.

### Task 2
Coolz. The next task is to answer another question and get an idea of whether your answer was a good one.

### Task 3
Wicked. The next task is to answer yet another question, get some feedback as to how to improve your answer, and then to improve the answer.

### Task 4
Hell yeah! The next task is to answer a long question, as if you were practising exam questions.

### Task 5
Bangin'. The final task is to get feedback on your final answer and find out how long you have been using the app today.

## Wrap up

* What is your occupation?
