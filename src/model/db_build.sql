At the end of the first act it is as salt* and rapid as good comedy dialogue should be. Elsewhere it is several times forced and tedious beyond expression, and in the third act one long passage of highly worked-up witticisms, during the delivery of which the action makes almost a dead halt, is intolerably artificial in its own substance and still more in the crude and unprepared manner of its introduction. *salt = rude'), ('Tybalt: What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.<br>Benvolio: I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<br>Or manage it to part these men with me.');
