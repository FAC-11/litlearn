# Sprint 1 User Research Synthesis 

## Summary
We carried out user testing at the end of our first sprint of building our GCSE English Learning app _*LitLearn*_.

We tested the entire MVP which consisted of a single short question with 1 multiple choice question which requires a short explanation. 

## Methodology 

We had 4 tasks that we asked participants to carry out. These were:
1. Imagine you are a student practicing for their GCSE exam. Show us how you would answer a question.
2. *Now imagine you would like to answer a different question. Show us how you would answer a new random question.*
3. *Now imagine you would like to answer a different question. Show us how you would select a new question.*
4. Finally, show us how you would get information about your progress.

## Results 

table of results with feedback per page?

### Splash and Login

### Question choice
* users liked the different colours of the option buttons 
* users felt they were expected to click a button on every row 
* users would like to be able to unselect options and have impossible ones greyed out 
* they would like the questions (as opposed to the question tags) to be more obviously clickable / (or visible?
* the questions at the bottom of the page weren't spotted by several users
* one user said he'd like a homepage option from this page

### Introduction page
* could do with more explanation of why they're using the site and how it would help them 
* the title was disproportionately large for the rest of the page and one user said they would have preferred larger font here and in the extract page
* a button to refresh the page to choose a different question (e.g. if they'd answered it already) would have been nice
* perhaps we could provide more scene context here to help students make sense of what they're about to read - one user found himself trying to remember what he knew about the Shakespeare characters before he read the page

### Extract 
* again, the heading was disproportionately large
* user expected context to the small extract

### Multiple choice
* the nav bar at the bottom overlapped the option buttons, which looked less professional
* two of the users said they liked having the extract in front of them as they were doing the multiple-choice question

### Help modal
* not everyone was clear that the lightbulb signified help

### 'Explain your answer'
* Autocorrect can be inappropriate - eg using Shakespearean names/ spelling
* no-one commented on or followed the prompt to use quotes from the answer

### question congratulations
* one user said he wanted to know whether his answer was correct - didn't feel sure that he 'deserved' a medal
    * another said he'd be interested in seeing a graphical display of multiple choice options selected by other users
* and another realised the difficulty, but wanted *some* feedback on his responses

### overall congratulations
* decimals of minutes weren't so helpful
* users would like to see previous questions completed

### Recommendations of Priorities for Sprint 2 :clipboard:
* __Answer Validation__ 
    * Work on a way to provide users with feedback on their answers 
* __Improve UX__
    * Grey out selection options that are no longer valid when choosing questions 
    * Improve navigation to question choices after submitting form 
    * Basic adjustments to font sizes and screen compatibility
